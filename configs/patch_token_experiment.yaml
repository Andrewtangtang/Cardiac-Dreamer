  # Notes
  description: "Patch token approach: 49 spatial tokens (512-dim each) + 1 action token. 95.7% faster inference with better spatial structure preservation."

# Patch Token Specific Notes:
# 
# Key Advantages:
# - 95.7% faster forward pass compared to channel tokens
# - Better spatial structure preservation (each patch = spatial location)
# - More aligned with Vision Transformer principles
# - Only 1.6% more parameters than channel approach
# 
# Architecture Details:
# - Token 0: Action token (at1->at2) [1 x 768]
# - Token 1-49: Patch tokens (spatial locations) [49 x 768]
# - Each patch token represents one 7x7 spatial location with full 512-dim features
# - Final output: Average pooling across patch tokens -> 512-dim vector for guidance
# 
# Expected Benefits:
# - Faster training and inference
# - Better spatial reasoning
# - More efficient attention computation (50 tokens vs 513 tokens)
